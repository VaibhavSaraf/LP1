### Problem Statement
# Group A: 410241:High Performance Computing

 A1. 
 a) Implement Parallel Reduction using Min, Max, Sum and Average operations.
 b) Write a CUDA program that, given an N-element vector, find-
    - The maximum element in the vector
    - The minimum element in the vector
    - The arithmetic mean of the vector
    - The standard deviation of the values in the vector
Test for input N and generate a randomized vector V of length N (N should be large). The program should generate output as the two computed maximum values as well as the time taken to find each value

# Group C: 410243-Data Analytics

C1.
Download the Iris flower dataset or any other dataset into a DataFrame. 
(eg https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris ) Use Python/R and Perform following
- How many features are there and what are their types (e.g., numeric,
nominal)?
- Compute and display summary statistics for each feature available in the
dataset. (eg. minimum value, maximum value, mean, range, standard
deviation, variance and percentiles
- Data Visualization-Create a histogram for each feature in the dataset to
illustrate the feature distributions. Plot each histogram.
- Create a boxplot for each feature in the dataset. All of the boxplots
should be combined into a single plot. Compare distributions and identify
outliers.

C2.
